## About Me

I'm **Adrian**, a final-year Computer Science student at **Loughborough University (UK)** and I am passionate about:
-  Hardware-software integration and low-level systems
-  Reverse engineering, binary analysis, and obfuscation
-  Artificial Intelligence — especially the mathematical foundations behind it

I enjoy clean logic, structured thinking, and bringing rigour to both system programming and AI research. When I’m not coding, I’m probably fixing my motorbike.

## AI & Data Science Experience

### Neural Networks

- Implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in **PyTorch** for classifying the **GTSRB traffic sign dataset**
  - Used `torchvision` transforms for normalization and augmentation to improve generalization
  - Trained both locally and with GPU acceleration
  - Tuned hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size to optimize performance
  - Evaluated using confusion matrices, accuracy plots, and loss curves

- Built a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** from scratch using **NumPy**  
  - Designed and implemented forward and backward propagation
  - Used **Pandas** for data handling and experiment tracking  
  - Focused on demystifying the math behind backpropagation and optimization

### Data Handling & Preprocessing

- Experience with:
  - Feature normalization
  - Data augmentation for robustness
  - Metric-based evaluation (accuracy, loss, etc.)

- Strong interest in **interpretable models**, **model behavior**, and **rigorous evaluation**.

## Featured Projects

### [Motorcycle Weather App](https://github.com/AdiNow04/RideSafeApp)
Created an android application for real time GPS weather tracking from scratch utilising various API's fetched from the web and native to android.
> Focused on Dynamic Layouts, external intents, caching of live data and UX.

### [Traffic Sign Classifier](https://github.com/AdiNow04/GTSRBcw)
Trained a CNN to classify German road signs (GTSRB) using PyTorch and torchvision.  
> Emphasis on generalization, data augmentation, and model tuning.

### [Scratch-Built MLP](https://github.com/AdiNow04/FirstMLP)
Built a mathematical MLP from scratch using NumPy and Pandas to better understand forward/backward propagation and loss functions.
